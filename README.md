# Digital Depot React Shop

[Digital Depot](https://digital-depot.netlify.app/) is a fictional online shop that focuses on the ability to purchase electronics, such as laptops and accessories. This website allows users to browse and add electronics to their cart. It uses React, Bootstrap, TypeScript, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and JSON.

## Project Features
- Users can view the homepage and find information about the fictional company
- The homepage has a slideshow created with jQuery and JavaScript that fades into each slide and lets you click on a specific slide to view
- Users can add items to their cart from the shop page
- The cart is saved in the user's local storage to be accessed later on
- Users can view their cart by clicking on the cart button, where a popup slides in from the right of the screen

## Future Plans
- Implement a responsive Testimonials section into the homepage
- Add more electronics to the shop
- Create a sorting/filter system to the shop
- Make the search bar at the top of the screen actually return data

## How to run the project
The project is currently hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and you can access it by clicking on the link in the repository. You don't need to install anything to use the website.

## How to use the project
- Go to the shop page and browse the products
- When you find an item that you like, click it and it will be added to your cart. You can also choose how much of that item you want.
- Click on the cart button on the top right of your screen to view all the items currently in your cart.
- Since this is a frontend-only website, the functionality ends here.
